\usage{
signNetwork(
  mat,
  directed = FALSE,
  loops = FALSE,
  matrix.type = c("adjacency", "edgelist"),
  vertex.names = NULL,
  vertex.attr = NULL,
  timepoints = NULL,
  tie.breaker = c("zero", "positive", "negative", "first", "last"),
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mat}{(List of) adjacency matrices or edgelists. For dynamic networks, provide a list.
Adjacency matrices must contain only -1, 0, or 1. Edgelists must have three columns: "From", "To", and "Sign".}

\item{directed}{Logical; should edges be interpreted as directed? Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{loops}{Logical; should loops be allowed? Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{matrix.type}{Either "adjacency" or "edgelist", indicating the format of the input.}

\item{vertex.names}{Optional. A vector or list of vertex names. If dynamic, provide a list aligned with `mat`.}

\item{vertex.attr}{Optional. Additional vertex attributes passed to the network constructor.}

\item{timepoints}{Optional. Either a single integer (number of desired pooled timepoints) or a list of index groups (e.g., list(1:3, 4:6)). Only applies to dynamic networks.}

\item{tie.breaker}{Character. Determines how to resolve sign conflicts when positives and negatives are equal within a pooling window. One of:
\itemize{
  \item `"zero"`: set to 0 (default)
  \item `"positive"`: set to 1
  \item `"negative"`: set to -1
  \item `"first"`: use the first nonzero sign
  \item `"last"`: use the last nonzero sign
}}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{network::network}.}
}
\value{
A signed network of class \code{"static.sign"} or \code{"dynamic.sign"}.
}
\description{
Turn an adjacency matrix or an edgelist into a static or dynamic signed network.
}
\examples{
# Static adjacency matrix
mat <- matrix(c(0, 1, -1, 1, 0, 0, -1, 0, 0), nrow = 3)
net <- signNetwork(mat, matrix.type = "adjacency")

# Dynamic network with pooling
mats <- replicate(6, mat, simplify = FALSE)
net_dyn <- signNetwork(mats, matrix.type = "adjacency", timepoints = 2, tie.breaker = "positive")

# Custom timepoint pooling
net_custom <- signNetwork(mats, matrix.type = "adjacency", timepoints = list(1:3, 4:6), tie.breaker = "first")

}
