\title{A signed multi- or dynamic-network representation.}
\usage{
networks.sign(..., dynamic = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Several signed networks or a list of signed networks.}

\item{dynamic}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, treat the input as a dynamic network; otherwise, as a multilayer network.}
}
\value{
A combined network object with appropriate constraints for model fitting.
}
\description{
Combines multiple signed networks into a single object for ERGM modeling.
Can represent either multilayer or dynamic network structures.
